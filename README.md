Case Study: Heart Disease Prediction using KNN Algorithm
Introduction
Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Early detection and prevention of heart disease can save lives and improve overall health outcomes. In this case study, we will explore how K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm can be used to predict the presence or absence of heart disease in patients based on their medical data.

Dataset
We will be using the Heart Disease UCI dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. This dataset contains 303 rows and 14 columns, where each row represents a patient and each column represents an attribute such as age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, etc. The target variable is a binary variable indicating the presence (values 1,2,3,4) or absence (value 0) of heart disease.

Data Preprocessing
Before we can apply KNN algorithm to predict heart disease, we need to preprocess the data to make it suitable for modeling. This involves the following steps:

Importing the dataset and checking for missing values
Encoding categorical variables
Splitting the data into training and testing sets
Scaling the data to normalize the feature values
Model Training and Evaluation
Once the data is preprocessed, we can train the KNN model using the training set and evaluate its performance using the testing set. We will use the scikit-learn library to implement the KNN algorithm.

The steps involved in training and evaluating the KNN model are as follows:

Choosing the value of K: We need to choose the number of neighbors (K) to consider when making predictions. We can try different values of K and choose the one that gives the best performance.
Training the model: We fit the KNN model to the training data.
Making predictions: We use the trained model to make predictions on the testing data.
Evaluating the performance: We evaluate the performance of the KNN model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Conclusion
In this case study, we explored how KNN algorithm can be used to predict heart disease in patients. We preprocessed the data, trained the KNN model, and evaluated its performance using testing data. By tuning the value of K and selecting appropriate performance metrics, we can build an accurate and reliable heart disease prediction model using KNN algorithm.
